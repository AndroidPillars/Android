# Java Basics Intro

- Java is a cross-platform object-oriented programming language that was released by Sun Microsystems in the year 1995.
- It is an object-oriented language similar to C++, but with advanced and simplified features.
- This language is free to access and can run on all platforms.

# How Java Works

- Java Souce File -> Compiler -> Bytecode (machine instructions) -> Device (with JVM)

# JVM

- JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is an abstract machine. 
- It is a specification that provides runtime environment in which java bytecode can be executed.
- JVMs are available for many hardware and software platforms (i.e. JVM is platform dependent).

# Code Structure

```ruby
public class MyClass {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World");
    }
}
```

# Java Variables and Concatenation

- A variable allow us to store a piece of data.
- It is a container/Bucket in memory.

__Strings__

```ruby
public class MyClass {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String mName = "Hello World";
        
        System.out.println("My Name is " +mName+ ".");
    }
}
```

__Integer__

```ruby
public class MyClass {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
         int mAge = 23;

        System.out.println("I am " +mAge+ " Years old");
    }
}
```

# Compiler

- Compiler is a internal java tool that checks for for errors, syntax.

- Java Source File -> 


# Points to get Remember

- File -> Power Save Mode -> To Disable the auto suggestions methods
